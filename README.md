# planeKF
Simple example of the Kalman Filter in MATLAB

MATLAB realization of the KF example explained by Michel van Biezen in his lecture series on the Kalman filter. See [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX2gX-ftPVXU3oUFNATxGXY90AULiqnWT) for the full lecture series. The example starts at [Lecture 27](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX2gX-ftPVXU3oUFNATxGXY90AULiqnWT).

**WARNING:** Do not implement the `Pp=diag(diag(Pp))' line outside this educational example. This is only to make the hand calculation demonstrated easier.
